(Please set a correct WFE-server name in af_delegate.properties before running RTN)

If there's path to swt-win32-3232.dll in system environment variable, run:
javaw -cp .;rtn.jar ru.runa.notifier.PlatformLoader

if swt-win32-3232.dll is in the same directory with rtn.jar, run:
javaw -Djava.library.path=. -cp .;rtn.jar ru.runa.notifier.PlatformLoader

if running runa rtn using runa_tasks.exe file, put swt-win32-3232.dll to the same directory with exe file.
