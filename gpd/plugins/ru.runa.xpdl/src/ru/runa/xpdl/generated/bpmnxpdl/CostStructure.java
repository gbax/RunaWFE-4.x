/**
 * Activities incur costs in a number of way, the use up
 * resources which may be people, machines, services, computers,
 * office space, etc.  Activities also use up fixed costs which
 * may be assigned on an activity by activity basis, thus allowing
 * for the assignment of overhead.  Fixed costs are assigned in bulk,
 * that is to say there is one fixed cost per activity.  However
 * resource costs are assigned on a resource by resource basis,
 * each one having a cost and an associated time unit.
