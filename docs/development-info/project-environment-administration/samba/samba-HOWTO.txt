preface:
Woody's default samba (samba-2.2.3a-13) does autenticate Windows clients
that are members of NT(Windows 2000) domain. Nevertheless Windows client
which is not domain member authenticates fine. The problem seems to be in diffenent
password verification methods: domain client checked agains pam db (but can't be
verified even if password is correct Unix password), non-domain client checked against
smbpasswd db.
Cause is still missing.

Walkaround:
install unofficial samba3 package from samba.org.
smb.conf configuration: 
encrypt passwords = true
passwd backend = smbpasswd

also you must add every valid user in smbpasswd file (parameter 'smb passwd' file in smb.conf)
and (optionaly) provide correct samba-to-unix users map (parameter 'username map' in smb.conf).
