<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Manager decides to send an employee to a business trip. Manager initiates the business process by completing &ldquo;Send an employee to a business trip&rdquo; form. The employee receives notification and must confirm it. If the business trip is local then the business process ends. Otherwise the trip is to another region. In this case a human resource inspector must &ldquo;make an official order&rdquo;. Then the employee receives a task &ldquo;sign the order&rdquo; and the human resource inspector receives a task &ldquo;receive a signature on the order&rdquo; simultaneously. Next the employee's task is to &ldquo;receive a business trip warrant&rdquo; and inspector receives a task &ldquo;give a business trip warrant&rdquo;.
